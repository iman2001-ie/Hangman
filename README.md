# Hangman Game Project

## Overview

This Hangman Game project, completed in January 2023, is a classic implementation of the popular word-guessing game. I developed it using Python, applying fundamental programming concepts such as lists, loops, and conditional statements.


## Features

- **Interactive Text-Based Interface:** The game features a user-friendly text-based interface that engages players in the word-guessing challenge.
- **Player Input Validation:** Robust input validation ensures that player guesses are accurate and within the game's rules.
- **Random Word Selection:** The game selects words randomly from a predefined list of 42 words, ensuring each playthrough is unique.
- **Graphical Hangman Figure:** To enhance the gaming experience, I implemented a graphical hangman figure that evolves as players make incorrect guesses.


## Credits
